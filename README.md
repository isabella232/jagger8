Jagger8
==========

This is fork of [Jagger](https://github.com/griddynamics/jagger) load testing tool.
Current fork is addressed to migrate to latest version of java(java 8) and third-party dependencies which should be changed to be compatible with java8 like springframework, hibernate, jaspperreports.

List of uprades:
* *Java* - from *6* to *8*.
* *Spring Framework* - from 3.1.4.RELEASE to 4.2.2.RELEASE
* *Hibernate* - from 3.5.2.Final to 3.6.9.Final
* *JasperReports* - from 4.0.1 to 6.1.1
* *Slf4j* - from 1.5.2 to 1.7.5
* *Guava* - from r9 to 17.0

 
### Project state
Is not realised but is able to be built from source with option *-Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true*

When fixes related to javadoc generation will be finished, then theoretically this fork will be transferred to griddynamics Jagger repository.
